# Gradle CVE Dependency Check

This is a plugin to be able to run the OWASP CVE Dependency Check in a gradle project. 

## Status
This project is current functional MVP. You could use the plugin in your project but it is completely un-configurable and performance
is probably pretty poor. Right now, any detected vulnerability of any level will result in a build failure. 

## Build Status
[![Build Status](https://snap-ci.com/danielsomerfield/gradle-cve-dependency-check/branch/master/build_image)](https://snap-ci.com/danielsomerfield/gradle-cve-dependency-check/branch/master)

## Known Issues
- Upload archives step is rebuilding the entire project because somehow the gradle history or archives are getting blown away
- Although it really shouldn't be necessary gradle dependencies required the jar to be signed, which is forcing the need to have the gpg keyring configured.

## RoadMap
- Publishing
    
- Testing
    - Better mocking strategy that doesn't kick up actual DependencyCheck system
    - More comprehensive unit tests
    - Perf test automation
    - Add stub server for CVE database so E2E tests don't fail when CVE db is down
- Reporting
    - Not yet implemented
- Architecture
    - Add seam between gradle plugin and DependencyCheck so it can be replaced with another source
- Add configuration for
    - build failure threshold 
    - CVE data sources
    - subproject aggragation strategy
    - autoupdate enable/disable
    - reporting
        - output directory
        - output format
    - CVE Suppression
    - Configurations to run against
- Performance testing and enhancements (e.g. better CVE data caching)

## More information
Inspiration for this project comes from the Maven plugin which is part of the OWASP Dependency Check project. More information on that project
is available on [github](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck) and the [OWASP website](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check).
