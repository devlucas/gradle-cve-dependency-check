# Gradle CVE Dependency Check

This is a plugin to be able to run the OWASP CVE Dependency Check in a gradle project. 

## Configuration
You can use and add configuration with cvecheck extension like so:

```
apply plugin: 'dependencycheck'

buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath group:'com.danielsomerfield.dependencycheck', name:'gradle-cve-dependency-check', version: '0.1.+'
    }
}

cvecheck {
    refreshAfter = 1000 //The refresh time in seconds
}
```

## Status
This project is current functional MVP. You could use the plugin in your project but it is mostly un-configurable. 
Right now, any detected vulnerability of any level will result in a build failure.

## Release notes
- Added refreshAfter so that CVE database is cached for at least the time specified

## Known Issues
- Build
    - Upload archives step is rebuilding the entire project because somehow the gradle history or archives are getting blown away
    - Although it really shouldn't be necessary gradle dependencies required the jar to be signed, which is forcing the need to have the gpg keyring configured.

## RoadMap
- Reporting
- Testing
    - Perf test automation
    - Add stub server for CVE database so E2E tests don't fail when CVE db is down
- Add configuration for
    - build failure threshold 
    - CVE data sources
    - subproject aggragation strategy
    - reporting
        - output directory
        - output format
    - CVE Suppression
    - Configurations to run against

## More information
Inspiration for this project comes from the Maven plugin which is part of the OWASP Dependency Check project. More information on that project
is available on [github](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck) and the [OWASP website](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check).
